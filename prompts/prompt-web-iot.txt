## Tips for Best Results

### Before Using the Prompt

1. **Define your tags carefully**: Choose tags that would help learners find this lesson
   - Examples: `python`, `functions`, `variables`, `async-programming`, `beginner-friendly`
2. **Consider your audience**: Specificity about difficulty level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) improves output quality
3. **Customize the context**: Replace [CONTEXT] with something relevant to your audience

### After Getting Generated Content

1. **Review for accuracy**: Verify all code examples are correct
2. **Check the structure**: Confirm all sections are present and well-organized
3. **Validate metadata**: Ensure title, tags, and learning objectives are clear
4. **Test readability**: Read through as if you were the target learner
5. **Fix any issues**: Small edits often needed (typos, formatting, clarity)
6. **Add visuals**: Consider adding diagrams or screenshots if helpful

### Common Customizations

**For Python lessons**:
```
[TOPIC]: "Python Functions"
[LEVEL]: "Beginner"
